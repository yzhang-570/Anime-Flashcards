## Notes

Due to not having a full understanding of how state works in React between or during renders, I had a lot of trouble trying to make sure that my states were being updated accordingly at first. However, after doing a bit of research on the internet and learning more about technicalities surrounding React states, I was able to resolve these issues and implement the required features.
